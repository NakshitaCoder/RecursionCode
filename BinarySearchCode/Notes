Agnostic Binary Search
Definition: A binary search that works on sorted arrays, regardless of whether they are sorted in
ascending or descending order.

Steps
1:- Identify Order:
    Check if the first element is less than the last element:
        Ascending Order: arr[0] < arr[n-1]
        Descending Order: arr[0] > arr[n-1]

2:- Binary Search:
    Use a standard binary search loop:
        Calculate the middle index.
        Check if the middle element is the target.
        Adjust the search range based on the identified order.
