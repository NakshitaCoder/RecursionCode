## Introduction

This bootcamp is designed to help you build a strong foundation in DSA and Dynamic Programming. You'll learn key concepts and techniques that are essential for coding interviews and competitive programming.

Quick Notes on DSA
**1. Data Structures**
**Arrays:**
  Fixed-size, contiguous memory.
  Access via index.
  Time Complexity: O(1) for access, O(n) for insertion/deletion.
  Linked Lists:

  Dynamic size, nodes linked via pointers.
  Types: Singly, Doubly, Circular.
  Time Complexity: O(n) for access, O(1) for insertion/deletion.
  
**Stacks:**
  LIFO structure.
  Operations: push(), pop(), peek().
  Use cases: Undo mechanisms, expression parsing.
  
**Queues:**
FIFO structure.
Operations: enqueue(), dequeue(), front().
Use cases: Task scheduling, buffer handling.

**Trees:**
Hierarchical structure.
Binary Trees: Each node has at most two children.
Binary Search Trees (BST): Left < root < right.
Time Complexity: O(log n) for balanced trees.

**Graphs:**
Collection of nodes and edges.
Represented via adjacency lists or matrices.
Types: Directed, Undirected, Weighted.


**2. Algorithms**
Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort: Simple but inefficient. O(n^2).
Quick Sort: Divide and conquer. Average O(n log n).
Merge Sort: Stable and efficient. O(n log n).
Searching Algorithms:

Linear Search: O(n).
Binary Search: O(log n) on sorted arrays.
Recursion:

Function calls itself.
Can lead to elegant solutions but watch for stack overflow.
Dynamic Programming:

Breaks problems into simpler overlapping subproblems.


**Techniques: Memoization and Tabulation.**
Example problems: Fibonacci, Knapsack, Coin Change.

**Key Complexity Classes**********
O(1): Constant time.
O(log n): Logarithmic time.
O(n): Linear time.
O(n log n): Linearithmic time.
O(nÂ²): Quadratic time.

**Conclusion**
Mastering DSA is crucial for efficient problem-solving and coding interviews. Focus on understanding the concepts, practicing implementations, and analyzing time and space complexity.
